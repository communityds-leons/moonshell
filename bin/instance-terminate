# This script makes it easy to properly terminate an instance that was launched
# inside an Auto-Scaling Group. You can simply `aws ec2 terminate-instance`,
# but this has the, slightly, undesired consequence of relying on the health
# checks to fail, which may take many minutes, before the instance is replaced.
