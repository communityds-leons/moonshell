# with using sudo and running outside of a full shell as `/etc/profile.d/*.sh`
# does not get automatically sourced.
#
# In the following example we are executing `sudo ... yii` from the
# `/var/www/vhost/foo.example.com` directory on all `app` hosts, we resolve RR
# records, on the staging environment of the product/app we are currenlty in.
#
# Example:
#
# $ bastion-exec-vhost staging app foo.example.com sudo /opt/rh/rh-php56/root/usr/bin/php yii app/update
